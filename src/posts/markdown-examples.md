# Markdown Extension Examples

This page demonstrates some of the built-in markdown extensions provided by VitePress.

## Syntax Highlighting

VitePress provides Syntax Highlighting powered by [Shiki](https://github.com/shikijs/shiki), with additional features like line-highlighting:

```ts
import { createContext, useContext, useState, useMemo } from "react";

// This is a simpler example, but you can imagine a more complex object here
type ComplexObject = {
  kind: string;
};

// The context is created with `| null` in the type, to accurately reflect the default value.
const Context = createContext<ComplexObject | null>(null);

// The `| null` will be removed via the check in the Hook.
const useGetComplexObject = () => {
  const object = useContext(Context);
  if (!object) {
    throw new Error("useGetComplexObject must be used within a Provider");
  }
  return object;
};

export default function MyApp() {
  const object = useMemo(() => ({ kind: "complex" }), []);

  return (
    <Context value={object}>
      <MyComponent />
    </Context>
  );
}

function MyComponent() {
  const object = useGetComplexObject();

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current object: {object.kind}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
