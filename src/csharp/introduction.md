# Inroduction

Welcome to the C# tutorials! This collection contains solutions designed to help students learn and practice C# programming through hands-on exercises and examples.

## Overview

My [GitHub repository](https://github.com/musicvano/Tutorials) serves as a centralized learning resource featuring multiple programming tasks, each organized as a separate Visual Studio solution. The tutorials are designed to progressively build your understanding of C# concepts and best practices.

## Repository Structure

Each tutorial is contained in its own directory with a complete Visual Studio solution:

```

- **Run:** Press `F5` to run with debugging or `Ctrl+F5` to run without debugging

## Getting Help

If you encounter difficulties:

1. Review the tutorial's README and code comments
2. Check that you have the correct .NET SDK version installed
3. Ensure all NuGet packages are restored (`Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Restore`)
4. Consult your tutor

## Best Practices

- Read carefully, understand the requirements before coding
- Don't be afraid to modify and test different approaches
- Practice writing clear, helpful comments
- Consider creating your own branch for solutions
- Learning is a collaborative process
